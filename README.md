# dotnet_iot_samples

Working on project to recurse dotnet/iot/src/Devices/<Device Names>/samples directories and get a list and project info. **_Done_**


The intention is for user to select a sample project and to either build and remotely deploy the  sample, or or to deploy the project and source files to the remote location for building there.

Requires the dotnet/iot  or djaus2/iot repository tree to be present locally.  
Set this in the server's appsettings.json
